# Students-Exam-Scores-Using-Python

# Objective: 
Analyze the influence of personal and socio-economic factors on student performance in three subjects (Math, Reading, and Writing) and provide insights on how these factors interact with each other.
# Features:

1.Gender: Gender of the student (male/female)

2.EthnicGroup: Ethnic group of the student (A, B, C, D, E)

3.ParentEduc: Education level of the student's parents (some_highschool, high_school, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree)

4.LunchType: Type of school lunch received (standard, free/reduced)

5.TestPrep: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (completed, none)

6.ParentMaritalStatus: Marital status of the student's parents (married, single, widowed, divorced)

7.PracticeSport: Frequency of sports practice (never, sometimes, regularly)

8.IsFirstChild: Whether the student is the first child in the family (yes, no)

9.NrSiblings: Number of siblings the student has (0-7)

10.TransportMeans: Means of transport to school (schoolbus, private)

11.WklyStudyHours: Weekly self-study hours (less than 5 hrs, between 5 and 10 hrs, more than 10 hrs)

12.MathScore: Math test score (0-100)

13.ReadingScore: Reading test score (0-100)

14.WritingScore: Writing test score (0-100)

# Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:

Identify Missing Values: Check for missing values and decide on a strategy for handling them.

Imputation Strategies:
Use mean/median for numerical features and mode/frequent value for categorical features.

Data Cleaning:
Consistent Data Types: Convert categorical variables to numerical formats for analysis if needed.

Outlier Handling:
Identify and address outliers in numerical features such as MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore.

# Summary Statistics: 

Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

# Data Visualization

1.Bar Charts: Compare average scores across different categories (e.g., Gender).

2.Heatmap: Relationship between Parent's Eduction and Student's Score,Relationship between ParentMaritalStatus and Student's Score.

3.Pie Chart: Distribution of Ethnic Groups

# Insights and Conclusions
Identify significant factors affecting Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
